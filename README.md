### Course 7 - Data Visualization with Python <br>
"A picture is worth a thousand words". We are all familiar with this expression. It especially applies when trying to explain the insight obtained from the analysis of increasingly large datasets. Data visualization plays an essential role in the representation of both small and large-scale data.

One of the key skills of a data scientist is the ability to tell a compelling story, visualizing data and findings in an approachable and stimulating way. Learning how to leverage a software tool to visualize data will also enable you to extract information, better understand the data, and make more effective decisions.

The main goal of this Data Visualization with Python course is to teach you how to take data that at first glance has little meaning and present that data in a form that makes sense to people. Various techniques have been developed for presenting data visually but in this course, we will be using several data visualization libraries in Python, namely Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium.

> > For this assignment, I generate two visualization plots:<br>
> > 1. The first plot uses the artist layer of Matplotlib to replicate a given bar chart which summarizes the results of a survey conducted to gauge audience interest in different data science topics. <br>
> > 2. The second plot is a Choropleth map which visualizes crime rates in San Francisco neighborhoods using a GeoJSON file that marks the boundaries of the neighborhoods.<br><br>

> > The Capstone Project for this course, Battle of the Neighborhoods, involves the identification of a business problem that requires location data and neighborhood clustering, and the selection of a dataset to analze to solve that business problem. Foursquare location data is leveraged to explore or compare neighborhoods. My project, "Moving to Palm Beach County, Florida", provides seniors with information to help them better determine which neighborhoods they should explore further when considering relocation to that county. <br>
> > #### Preliminary Skills Required
> > In order to complete the project, the following skills are necessary:<br>
> > 1. Make calls to the Foursquare API including construction of a URL to send a request to the API to:<br> 
&emsp; search for a specific type of venue, <br>
&emsp; to explore a particular venue, <br>
&emsp; to explore a Foursquare user, <br>

> > #### Assignment - Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto
> > In this assignment I explore, segment, and cluster neighborhoods in the city of Toronto based on postal code and borough information and then replicate the analysis I did on the New York City dataset. However, unlike New York City, the neighborhood data is not readily available on the internet. But a Wikipedia page does exist that has all the information needed to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. In order to get the data into a structured format like the NYC dataset, I scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean the data, and then read it into a *pandas* dataframe.<br><br>

> > Currently trending, many active seniors, especially those who live in states like New York and New Jersey, once retired, look to relocate to a warmer, less expensive location like Florida. They would like to move to an area where they can still enjoy many of the same activities in their new home as they enjoyed in their northern one, while maintaining a comparable quality of life in terms of affordability and demographics.<br><br>
An important consideration for active seniors is to move to an area that is close to family and friends, as well as an area that their guests, including grandchildren, can enjoy visiting. For this study, that area will be limited to Palm Beach County, Florida. Palm Beach County is a large area - 2,386 square miles - on the east coast of Florida consisting of 39 municipalities.<br><br>
Although there are many factors to consider when moving to a new neighborhood such as available social activities, recreational activities, access to healthcare, as well as the crime rate, taxes, affordability, and public amenities including transportation, this study will focus on venue data collected by Foursquare.<br><br>
Foursquare provides a variety of categories of venues such as restaurants, shopping, and leisure activities. This study will cluster neighborhoods (municipalities) in Palm Beach County, Florida by venues collected from Foursquare. In addition, median income, median property value, population density, and area (square miles) data will be collected and analyzed.<br><br>
The goal of the analysis is to provide seniors with information that will help them make a better determination as to which areas they should explore further when considering relocation to Palm Beach County, Florida.<br><br>
This project utilizes *k*-means to cluster neighborhoods. Three clusters are identified and analyzed.<br><br>
