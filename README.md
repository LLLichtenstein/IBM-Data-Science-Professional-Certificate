## Certificate Course Projects: <br>
### Course 1 - What is Data Science <br>
> > The art of uncovering the insights and trends in data has been around since ancient times. The ancient Egyptians used census data to increase efficiency in tax collection and they accurately predicted the flooding of the Nile river every year. Since then, people working in data science have carved out a unique and distinct field for the work they do. This field is data science. In this course, students meet data science practitioners and get an overview of what data science is today.<br><br>
> > This essay assignment demonstrates my understanding of what data science is, what data scientists do and what deliverables comprise a data science project.<br>

### Course 3 - Data Science Methodology <br>
> > Despite the recent increase in computing power and access to data over the last couple of decades, our ability to use the data within the decision making process is too often either lost or not maximized. As such, we don't have a solid understanding of the questions being asked and how to apply the data correctly to the problem at hand. This course presents a methodology applicable to data science which ensures that the data used in problem solving is relevant and properly manipulated to address the question at hand.<br>
> > Students learn:<br>
> > &emsp; 1. The major steps involved in tackling a data science problem.<br>
> > &emsp; 2. The major steps involved in practicing data science, including:<br>
> > &emsp; &emsp; forming a concrete business or research problem, <br>
> > &emsp; &emsp; collecting and analyzing data, <br>
> > &emsp; &emsp; building a model, and <br>
> > &emsp; &emsp; understanding the feedback after model deployment.<br>
> > &emsp; 3. How data scientists think!<br><br>

### Course 5 - Databases and SQL for Data Science <br>
> > Much of the world's data resides in databases. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful language which is used for communicating with and extracting data from databases. This course introduces relational database concepts in order to learn and apply a foundational knowledge of the SQL language while performing SQL access in a data science environment. The emphasis in this course is hands-on and practical learning. As such, students work with real databases, real data science tools, and real-world datasets. They create a database instance in the cloud, and through a series of hands-on labs practice building and running SQL queries. Students also learn how to access databases from Jupyter notebooks using SQL and python.<br><br>
> > For this assignment I loaded snap shots of three real world datasets provided by the Chicago Data Portal into a DB2 database and executed SQL queries to answer questions to help me understand the data as a data scientist would. <br>
> > The three datasets are:
> > 1. Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago, which contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a “hardship index” for each Chicago community area for the years 2008 – 2012.<br>
> > 2. Chicago Public Schools, which shows all school level performance data used to create CPS School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year, and <br>
> > 3. Chicago Crime Data, which reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to the date the dataset was extracted, minus the most recent seven days.<br>
> >
> > NOTE: The downloaded datasets are subsets of the original Chicago Data Portal datasets and have some of the column names modified to be more database friendly to make it easier to complete the assignment.<br><br>

### Course 6 - Data Analysis with Python <br>
> > Students learn how to analyze data using python from the basics of python to exploring different types of data including data preparation, simple statistical analysis, data visualization, and future trend prediction.<br>
> > Topics covered include:<br>
> > &emsp; 1. Importing datasets<br>
> > &emsp; 2. Cleaning the data<br>
> > &emsp; 3. Data frame manipulation<br>
> > &emsp; 4. Summarizing the data<br>
> > &emsp; 5. Building machine learning Regression models<br>
> > &emsp; 6. Building data pipelines<br>
> >Students learn to use pandas, NumPy and SciPy libraries to work with a sample dataset. Specifically, pandas is used to load, manipulate, analyze, and visualize datasets, and scikit-learn machine learning algorithms are used to build smart models and make predictions.<br><br>
> > For this assignment, I am a data analyst working at a real estate investment trust which invests in residential real estate. I am tasked with determining the market price of homes given a set of features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, etc. Using IBM Watson Studio, I analyze and predict housing prices by fitting these attributes or features to a Linear Regression model. The dataset used contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle, for homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.<br><br>

### Course 7 - Data Visualization with Python <br>
> > "A picture is worth a thousand words". We are all familiar with this expression. It especially applies to visualizing analytical insights from both small and large datasets. 
A key data science skill is the ability to tell a compelling story by visualizing data and analytical findings in an approachable and stimulating way. Visualization software tools enable information extraction in order to better understand the data, and make more effective decisions. This course teaches students how to take data that at first glance has little meaning and to present that data in a form that makes sense to people by using several data visualization libraries in python, namely Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium.<br><br>
> > For this assignment, I generate two visualization plots:<br>
> > &emsp; 1. The first plot uses the artist layer of Matplotlib to replicate a given bar chart which summarizes the results of a survey conducted to gauge audience interest in different data science topics. <br>
> > &emsp; 2. The second plot is a Choropleth map which visualizes crime rates in San Francisco neighborhoods using a GeoJSON file that marks the boundaries of the neighborhoods.<br>

> > The Capstone Project for this course, Battle of the Neighborhoods, involves the identification of a business problem that requires location data and neighborhood clustering, and the selection of a dataset to analze to solve that business problem. Foursquare location data is leveraged to explore or compare neighborhoods. My project, "Moving to Palm Beach County, Florida", provides seniors with information to help them better determine which neighborhoods they should explore further when considering relocation to that county. <br>
> > #### Preliminary Skills Required
> > In order to complete the project, the following skills are necessary:<br>
> > 1. Make calls to the Foursquare API including construction of a URL to send a request to the API to:<br> 
&emsp; search for a specific type of venue, <br>
&emsp; to explore a particular venue, <br>
&emsp; to explore a Foursquare user, <br>
&emsp; to explore a geographical location, and <br>
&emsp; to get trending venues around a location. <br>
> > Use the visualization library, Folium, to visualize the results.<br><br>

> > #### Assignment - Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto
> > In this assignment I explore, segment, and cluster neighborhoods in the city of Toronto based on postal code and borough information and then replicate the analysis I did on the New York City dataset. However, unlike New York City, the neighborhood data is not readily available on the internet. But a Wikipedia page does exist that has all the information needed to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. In order to get the data into a structured format like the NYC dataset, I scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean the data, and then read it into a *pandas* dataframe.<br><br>

> > &emsp; a description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem.<br><br>
> > Currently trending, many active seniors, especially those who live in states like New York and New Jersey, once retired, look to relocate to a warmer, less expensive location like Florida. They would like to move to an area where they can still enjoy many of the same activities in their new home as they enjoyed in their northern one, while maintaining a comparable quality of life in terms of affordability and demographics.<br><br>
An important consideration for active seniors is to move to an area that is close to family and friends, as well as an area that their guests, including grandchildren, can enjoy visiting. For this study, that area will be limited to Palm Beach County, Florida. Palm Beach County is a large area - 2,386 square miles - on the east coast of Florida consisting of 39 municipalities.<br><br>
Although there are many factors to consider when moving to a new neighborhood such as available social activities, recreational activities, access to healthcare, as well as the crime rate, taxes, affordability, and public amenities including transportation, this study will focus on venue data collected by Foursquare.<br><br>
Foursquare provides a variety of categories of venues such as restaurants, shopping, and leisure activities. This study will cluster neighborhoods (municipalities) in Palm Beach County, Florida by venues collected from Foursquare. In addition, median income, median property value, population density, and area (square miles) data will be collected and analyzed.<br><br>
The goal of the analysis is to provide seniors with information that will help them make a better determination as to which areas they should explore further when considering relocation to Palm Beach County, Florida.<br><br>
This project utilizes *k*-means to cluster neighborhoods. Three clusters are identified and analyzed.<br><br>
