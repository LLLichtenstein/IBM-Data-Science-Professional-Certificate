### Course 5 - Databases and SQL for Data Science <br>
> > For this assignment I loaded into a DB2 database and executed SQL queries on snap shots of three real world datasets provided by the Chicago Data Portal to answer questions to help me understand the data just like a data scientist would. <br><br>
> > The three datasets are:<br>
> > 1. Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago, which contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a “hardship index” for each Chicago community area for the years 2008 – 2012.<br>
> > 2. Chicago Public Schools, which shows all school level performance data used to create CPS School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year, and <br>
> > 3. Chicago Crime Data, which reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to the date the dataset was extracted, minus the most recent seven days.<br>
> >
> > NOTE: The downloaded datasets are subsets of the original Chicago Data Portal datasets and have some of the column names modified to be more database friendly to make it easier to complete the assignment.<br><br>

### Course 6 - Data Analysis with Python <br>
> > For this assignment, I am a data analyst working at a real estate investment trust which invests in residential real estate. I am tasked with determining the market price of homes given a set of features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, etc. Using IBM Watson Studio, I analyze and predict housing prices by fitting these attributes or features to a Linear Regression Model. The dataset used contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle, for homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.<br><br>

### Course 7 - Data Visualization with Python <br>
> > For this assignment, I generate two visualization plots:<br>
> > 1. The first plot uses the artist layer of Matplotlib to replicate a given bar chart which summarizes the results of a survey conducted to gauge audience interest in different data science topics. <br>
> > 2. The second plot is a Choropleth map which visualizes crime rates in San Francisco neighborhoods using a GeoJSON file that marks the boundaries of the neighborhoods.<br><br>
> > Assignment URL: https://github.com/LLLichtenstein/IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate/blob/master/Course%207%20Final%20Project%20Jupyter%20notebook.ipynb
### Course 8 - Machine Learning with Python <br>
> > For this project, I built a classifier in a Jupyter notebook on IBM Watson Studio to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. More specifically, I loaded a historical dataset of previous loan applications, cleaned the data, and applied K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression algorithms on the data to build my models. I used Jaccard index, F1-score, and Log Loss evaluation metrics to determine the accuracy of each classifier.<br><br>

### Course 9 - Applied Data Science Capstone<br>
> > The Capstone Project for this course, Battle of the Neighborhoods, involves the identification of a business problem that requires location data and neighborhood clustering, and the selection of a dataset to analze to solve that business problem. Foursquare location data is leveraged to explore or compare neighborhoods. My project, "Moving to Palm Beach County, Florida", provides seniors with information to help them better determine which neighborhoods they should explore further when considering relocation to that county. <br>
> > #### Preliminary Skills Required
> > In order to complete the project, the following skills are necessary:<br>
> > 1. Make calls to the Foursquare API including construction of a URL to send a request to the API to:<br> 
&emsp; search for a specific type of venue, <br>
&emsp; to explore a particular venue, <br>
&emsp; to explore a Foursquare user, <br>
&emsp; to explore a geographical location, and <br>
&emsp; to get trending venues around a location. <br>
> > Use the visualization library, Folium, to visualize the results.<br><br>
> > Lab 1 Foursquare API - URL with Folium maps: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/LLLichtenstein/IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate/blob/master/Course%209%20Lab%201%20Foursquare%20API.ipynb<br><br>
> > 2. Use *k*-means clustering:<br>
> > &emsp;on a randomly generated dataset, and <br>
> > &emsp;for customer segmentation.<br><br>
> > Lab 2 Clustering with k-means - URL: https://github.com/LLLichtenstein/IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate/blob/master/Course%209%20Lab%202%20Clustering%20with%20k-means.ipynb<br><br>
> > 3. Convert addresses into their equivalent latitude and longitude values in order to group neighborhoods into clusters.<br>
> > This lab also includes skills learned in Labs 1 and 2: <br>
> > &emsp;*k*-means clustering, and <br>
> > &emsp;Folium.<br><br>
> > Lab 3 Neigborhoods in New York City - URL with Folium maps: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/LLLichtenstein/IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate/blob/master/Course%209%20Lab%203%20Neigborhoods%20in%20NYC.ipynb<br>
> > #### Assignment - Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto
> > In this assignment I explore, segment, and cluster neighborhoods in the city of Toronto based on postal code and borough information and then replicate the analysis I did on the New York City dataset. However, unlike New York City, the neighborhood data is not readily available on the internet. But a Wikipedia page does exist that has all the information needed to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. In order to get the data into a structured format like the NYC dataset, I scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean the data, and then read it into a *pandas* dataframe.<br><br>

> > #### Capstone Project - Battle of the Neighborhoods - Moving to Palm Beach County, Florida
> > **Part 1 Business Problem**<br>
> > The first part of the project includes:<br>
> > &emsp; A description of the problem and a discussion of the background.<br>
> > &emsp; A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem.<br><br>
> > Currently trending, many active seniors, especially those who live in states like New York and New Jersey, once retired, look to relocate to a warmer, less expensive location like Florida. They would like to move to an area where they can still enjoy many of the same activities in their new home as they enjoyed in their northern one, while maintaining a comparable quality of life in terms of affordability and demographics.<br><br>
An important consideration for active seniors is to move to an area that is close to family and friends, as well as an area that their guests, including grandchildren, can enjoy visiting. For this study, that area will be limited to Palm Beach County, Florida. Palm Beach County is a large area - 2,386 square miles - on the east coast of Florida consisting of 39 municipalities.<br><br>
Although there are many factors to consider when moving to a new neighborhood such as available social activities, recreational activities, access to healthcare, as well as the crime rate, taxes, affordability, and public amenities including transportation, this study will focus on venue data collected by Foursquare.<br><br>
Foursquare provides a variety of categories of venues such as restaurants, shopping, and leisure activities. This study will cluster neighborhoods (municipalities) in Palm Beach County, Florida by venues collected from Foursquare. In addition, median income, median property value, population density, and area (square miles) data will be collected and analyzed.<br><br>
The goal of the analysis is to provide seniors with information that will help them make a better determination as to which areas they should explore further when considering relocation to Palm Beach County, Florida.<br><br>
This project utilizes *k*-means to cluster neighborhoods. Three clusters are identified and analyzed.<br><br>
> > **Part 2 Code and Report**<br>
> > The second part of the project includes:<br>
> > &emsp; A full report consisting of all of the following sections:
> > &emsp; &emsp; Introduction - the business problem,
> > &emsp; &emsp; Data - the data and its source,
> > &emsp; &emsp; Methodology - exploratory data analysis and inferential statistical testing discussion,
> > &emsp; &emsp; Results - results discussion,
> > &emsp; &emsp; Discussion - observations and recommendations,
> > &emsp; &emsp; Conclusion.<br>
